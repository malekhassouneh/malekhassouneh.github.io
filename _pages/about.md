Welcome! I am a Pre-doctoral Research Assistant at the University of Toronto and a member of the [Social Science Prediction Platform (SSPP)](https://socialscienceprediction.org/) team, working directly under Professors Eva Vivalt and Stefano DellaVigna. 

My research interests include microeconometrics, labor, and public economics, with a specific interest in studying the migration determinants of labor and patterns of income inequality. 

I graduated with a Master of Arts in Economics from the University of Toronto ('23), and a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from McGill University ('22).
