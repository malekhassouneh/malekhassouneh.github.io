Welcome! I am a pre-doctoral research assistant at the Department of Economics, University of Toronto and a member of the <span style = "color: black">[Social Science Prediction Platform (SSPP)](https://socialscienceprediction.org/)</span> team, working directly under Professors Eva Vivalt and Stefano DellaVigna. 

My research interests include microeconometrics, labor, and public economics, with a focus on the determinants of labor mobility and migration, and patterns of income inequality. 

I graduated with a Master of Arts in Economics from the University of Toronto ('23), and a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from McGill University ('22).
